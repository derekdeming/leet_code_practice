# leet_code_practice
You should never lose sight of the fundamentals so using this to play around and revisit very basic fundamentals of data structures and algorithms. Maybe will use the code to teach kids later on or it may just sit in the abyss of github code. Who knows... 

## Roadmap
* First derive the dynamic functionalities and methods in basic code
* Then we will do some exercises to apply these derivations/methods
* Finally we will practice leetcode... the dreaded pain in every programmers side

> Hoping to just use this to hold accountability to myself
